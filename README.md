# DMG
This is a General Purpose Software for solving Multi-phase Optimal Control Problems based on GPOPS.

This distribution is a derived work from "GPOPS" (Gauss Pseudospectral Optimization Software) published under the Simple Public License.
The original GPOPS distribution can be downloaded from [here](https://es.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/21729-gpops).

The main GPOPS features are:
..* Implements Gauss Pseudospectral Collocation Method for Transcribing the continuous optimal control problem into an Nonlinear Optimization Problem.
..* Interfaces with SNOPT
..* 

The new features DMG includes:
..* Implements Hermite Simpson Collocation Method for Transcribing the continuous optimal control problem into an Nonlinear Optimization Problem.
--* Interfaces with IPOPT
